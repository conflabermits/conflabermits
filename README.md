# ![Happy conflaberwaffle](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/blob/main/html/chrisdunaj.com/images/w00twaffle-blackbg.png?raw=true) Hi, I'm Chris! (conflabermits)


## Who am I?

I'm a dude. I like music and technology. Sometimes I [stream](https://twitch.tv/conflabermits) myself coding. I've got some info about me [here](https://chrisdunaj.com/) and [here](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/blob/main/stream/pilot/001/notes.md).

## What am I working on?

Right now I've got a bunch of abandoned projects, but of the active ones the most interesting probably are:

* [Python Wordle Helper](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/main/python/wordle), to help you get unstuck when you're stuck on Wordle.
* [Health Checker](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/main/golang/health_checker) and [Trusty Web Server](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/main/golang/trusty_web_server), a proof-of-concept self-improvement project in Go.
* [Python Subreddit Scanner](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/blob/main/python/reddit/scan_subreddit.py), for when you want to search the past `N` number of posts in a given subreddit for any content you specify and send it to yourself as a Reddit message.
* [OpenArgs FetchPost](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/blob/main/python/reddit/openargs/openargs_fetchpost.py), a Python script that I used to grab tweets from the [OpenArgs Twitter account](https://twitter.com/openargs) and post them to the [OpenArgs Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenArgs/).
* [Stream Notes](https://github.com/conflabermits/Scripts/tree/main/stream), where I've been keeping my notes from previous live coding streams.
